🎬 HOW TO ADD YOUR PRIVATE VIDEO

STEP 1: Prepare Your Video
---------------------------
1. Make sure your video is in MP4 format (most common)
2. Recommended: Keep file size under 100MB for faster loading
3. If video is too large, compress it using:
   - HandBrake (free software)
   - Online tools like cloudconvert.com
   - Or reduce quality/resolution

STEP 2: Add Video to Project
-----------------------------
1. Rename your video file to: video.mp4
2. Place it in THIS FOLDER (birthday-website/public/)
3. The file should be at: birthday-website/public/video.mp4

STEP 3: Test
------------
1. Refresh your browser
2. Click the "Click to Play" button
3. Your video should play!

ALTERNATIVE FORMATS:
-------------------
If you have WebM format, you can also add:
- video.webm (place in same folder)

The video player will automatically try both formats.

FILE STRUCTURE:
--------------
birthday-website/
├── public/
│   ├── video.mp4  ← PUT YOUR VIDEO HERE
│   └── vite.svg
├── src/
└── ...

TROUBLESHOOTING:
---------------
❌ Video not playing?
   → Check file name is exactly "video.mp4"
   → Check file is in public folder
   → Try refreshing browser (Ctrl+F5)
   → Check browser console (F12) for errors

❌ Video too slow to load?
   → Compress the video file
   → Reduce video quality/resolution
   → Use a shorter video

❌ Video not working on mobile?
   → Make sure file is MP4 format
   → Compress to smaller size
   → Test on actual device

PRIVACY:
--------
✅ Your video stays on your computer
✅ Only people with the website link can see it
✅ Not uploaded to any third-party service
✅ Completely private

When you deploy to Vercel/Netlify, the video will be uploaded
with your website files (still private, only accessible via your URL).

CURRENT STATUS:
--------------
The video player is ready and waiting for your video file!
Just add "video.mp4" to this folder and refresh the page.
